# OFSER
## What is OFSER?
OFSER (Office Facility Service Request) was developed by applying the concept Shared Services to streamline the process of creating and managing requests digitally through a web-based application. OFSER aims to provide information related to the process, flow, and overview of the utilization of digital technology within the Shared Services department. OFSER focuses on requests for office facility services, such as office supplies/printing materials, consumables, event support, refreshments, business cards, and more.
